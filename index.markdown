# Hello! ✌️ 
# My name is Jordan Myers! 

---

I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Arizona, studying natural language processing, computational linguistics, and machine learning in the [Human Language Technology MS program](https://uazhlt.github.io/).

My interests are varied and diverse but all converge around how people use and organize abstract signs and symbols to share information. That sounds like a fancy way of summing up the concept of *communication* but I'd also like to include the neuropsychological overlap that language processing has with musical processing! Over time I hope to contribute to the fields of natural language understanding, audio processing, machine hearing/audition, machine translation, and more.
