# Note 1

Hey! You've found my test note! I mean, it mustn't have been very hard as it should be listed with all my notes on the main blog navigation page :P

There isn't much else here, I really just wanted to test if I was separating main blog posts from notes using Jekyll's tag system correctly. 

And hey, I've done it!

see you around
